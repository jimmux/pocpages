# POCPages

A template I use for rapid POC web pages development - SvelteKit, TypeScript, Pug, Bulma, PagesCMS.

This is a combo I've found useful for setting up simple websites that allows for pretty simple, cheap, and effective collaboration with clients.

Using `svelte-preprocess` for Pug templates on Svelte, because I think better in whitespace.

I started using Bulma for CSS and components because it's always been a versatile and reliabel option, but switched to Flowbite Svelte because it currently has better support and the components lend themselves even better to rapid development. Better compatibility with Tailwind is a bonus.

PagesCMS is a very handy option for empowering clients to directly contribute copy.
