# POCPages

A template I use for rapid POC web pages development - SvelteKit, TypeScript, Pug, Bulma, PagesCMS.

This is a combo I've found useful for setting up simple websites that allows for pretty simple, cheap, and effective collaboration with clients.

Using `svelte-preprocess` for Pug templates on Svelte, because I think better in whitespace.

Bulma has always been a very practical default styling option, with pretty obvious classes and minimal work required to tweak it.

PagesCMS is a very handy option for empowering clients to directly contribute copy.
